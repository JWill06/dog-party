# Dog-Party

## Abstract
The goal of this project was to recreate a static display of the spec image below.

## Project Spec  
[https://frontend.turing.edu/projects/M2-static-comp-challenge.html](https://frontend.turing.edu/projects/M2-static-comp-challenge.html)

## Setup
1. Fork + clone down this repo
1. `cd` into the directory
1. Install the library dependencies with `npm install`
1. To verify that it is setup correctly, run `npm start` in your terminal. Go to `http://localhost:8080/` and you should see a page with the Turing logo image and a beautiful gradient background. If that's the case, you're good to go.
2. Enter `control + c` in your terminal to stop the server at any time.

## Wins
1. I was able to complete this project under 4 hours.
2. I was able to recreate the static comp almost exactly to spec with little issues.

## Challenges
1. Being able to properly keep the text spaced properly was a bit of a struggle.
2. Trying to prevent the page from having a scroll bar either way was nearly impossible. 

## Preview of page
